Ingredients:

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Instructions:

Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Cream the Butter and Sugars:
In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy and well combined.

Add Eggs:
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Gradually Add Dry Ingredients:
Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

Add Chocolate Chips and Nuts:
Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until they are evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.

Scoop Dough:
Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets, leaving enough space between each cookie for spreading.

Bake:
Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown around the edges. The centers should be slightly soft.

Cool on Baking Sheet:
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy:
Once completely cooled, enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness.

Feel free to customize this recipe by adding different mix-ins, such as dried fruit, white chocolate chips, or butterscotch chips. Happy baking!
